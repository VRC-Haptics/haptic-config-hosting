# haptic-config-hosting
Repository containing publicly available haptic configurations. Will be move to an actual endpoint eventually.


To get your custom Config's added:
1. Create a PR adding your maps under a new folder with your screen name under the `/configs/<Your_Name>` folder.
2. Send me a message on Discord: @is_average and I will get you set up.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Until there's enough users to justify infrastructure costs, I will have to keep track of who is allowed to edit what. 
DO NOT JUST EDIT ANOTHER PERSONS CONFIG FILE AND EXPECT IT TO GET MERGED.
